# Minesweeper
The most popular and addictive game of my childhood. Developed as a side project to practice some jQuery and CSS. Feel free to [play here](https://rakchan-minesweeper.firebaseapp.com/).

## Rules of the Game:
1. You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.
2. Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.
3. To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, right-click on it to mark it with a flag.
